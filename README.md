Rocket.Chat.Android.SDK
----------------------

<!--- Here are some features that SDK should provide
- Authentication in integration with native app username and password
- Sending and receiving messages, audio, video , document, images
- Listing out all subscribed channels and their types
- Local history of messages (this one needs to be determined)
- I think it would be more interesting if we provide pluggable UI componentz
- User can enable and disable the feature depending on his choice
- The user interface should have facility to synchronize with app theme, so that it should look as a part of native app
Feel free to add or edit the features :)

This SDK currently provides support to include livechat client functionality in any android app.
